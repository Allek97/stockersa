## ü•≥ About This Production <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

After learning how to build RESTful APIs with Explodii, I decided to create something exploiting third party APIs. I went for a stock market APIs. After trying multiple free APIs and trying to combine them to get the maximum of data with a decent request rate. I finally decided to redo everything and go with Financial Modeling Prep API I purchased their starter pack for absolute flexibility.

Charts were used to render the data from the API. I mainly used recharts react library and airbnb visx to build those charts. The features users can use in Stockersa :

-   Access real-time stock data, quotes(with price rate of change) and volumes up to 5 years back, with 7 different time periods.
-   Get access to the latest news related to the searched stock or the global market in general.
-   Get important daily key metrics like P/E Ratio, Earnings Per Share (Eps), market cap, average volume and more.
-   Get an overview of the company/corporation of your interests.
-   Get access to the yearly financial statements up to 5 years. Includes net income, gross profit, revenue, ebitda and more.
-   Get also access to the yearly expense information up to 5 years. With metrics like cost of revenue, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, selling and marketing expenses and more.
-   Get access to a Google map that tracks the company's headquarter and 65+ global exchanges all over the globe with key information.
